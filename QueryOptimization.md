### **Project: Optimizing SQL Queries for Large Datasets**

## **Overview**

In this project, I will:

1. **Focus on Indexing**: Understanding how to create indexes on frequently accessed columns to speed up query performance.
2. **Use Query Optimization Techniques**: Optimize SQL queries by analyzing execution plans and improving joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
3. **Performance Testing**: Measure the query performance before and after optimization to understand the impact of the changes.

This project is designed for SQL developers, data analysts, and engineers who want to improve query performance when working with large datasets.

### **Data Source**

I'll assume you are working with a **Sales Database**. The main tables I'll work with include:

#### **sales_data Table**
| order_id | customer_id | product_id | order_value | order_date  | region    |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1001     | C001        | P001       | 250.00      | 2023-05-01  | East      |
| 1002     | C002        | P002       | 150.00      | 2023-05-02  | West      |
| 1003     | C003        | P003       | 300.00      | 2023-05-03  | North     |

## **Key Tasks**

1. **Indexing**  
   - Analyze which columns are queried most often and apply indexes to improve query performance.
   - Indexing frequently queried columns, such as `order_date`, `product_id`, `customer_id`, etc.

2. **Query Optimization**  
   - Review and optimize queries by analyzing their execution plans.
   - Improve joins, subqueries, and aggregation logic to reduce runtime.

3. **Performance Testing**  
   - Compare query execution times before and after optimization.
   - Track improvements using `EXPLAIN` plans and actual query run times.

## **Step-by-Step Implementation**

---

### **1. Indexing**

#### **Creating Indexes for Faster Query Execution**

Indexes are created on frequently accessed columns that are often used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, or `GROUP BY` clauses.

For example, if you frequently query by `product_id`, `customer_id`, or `order_date`, I can create indexes on those columns.

```sql
-- Creating index on customer_id for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON sales_data(customer_id);

-- Creating index on product_id for faster join operations
CREATE INDEX idx_product_id ON sales_data(product_id);

-- Creating index on order_date for efficient date range queries
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON sales_data(order_date);
```

#### **Indexing Strategy**

- **Clustered vs. Non-clustered Indexes**: 
  - If you often query a specific range of dates, consider creating a **clustered index** on `order_date`.
  - For filtering by `customer_id` or `product_id`, **non-clustered indexes** are typically sufficient.

### **2. Query Optimization**

#### **Optimizing Queries Using Execution Plans**

Use the `EXPLAIN` command to analyze the execution plan of your queries and determine where optimizations can be made. Here's an example where I optimize a query that joins `sales_data` and `customer_data` to find total sales by customer.

Before optimization:

```sql
-- Unoptimized query to find total sales per customer
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    SUM(s.order_value) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data s
JOIN customer_data c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

This query may be slow if there is a lot of data in both tables and if there are no indexes on `customer_id`. Let's analyze its execution plan:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    SUM(s.order_value) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data s
JOIN customer_data c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

If I see that the query is performing a **full table scan**, I can add an index on `customer_id` in both tables:

```sql
-- Create index on customer_id in both tables
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_customer_id ON sales_data(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_customer_id ON customer_data(customer_id);
```

After indexing, rerun the query to check for improved performance:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    SUM(s.order_value) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data s
JOIN customer_data c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

#### **Optimizing Joins**

Let’s say I have a more complex query with multiple joins and subqueries. Here's an example:

```sql
-- Unoptimized query with multiple joins and subqueries
SELECT 
    s.order_id,
    c.customer_id,
    p.product_name,
    s.order_value
FROM sales_data s
JOIN customer_data c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN product_data p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE s.order_date > '2023-01-01'
AND c.loyalty_status = 'Platinum'
ORDER BY s.order_value DESC;
```

To optimize this, I can:
- Avoid unnecessary subqueries.
- Ensure proper indexing on `customer_id`, `product_id`, and `order_date`.

I can also check the execution plan to see if there are any missing indexes:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    s.order_id,
    c.customer_id,
    p.product_name,
    s.order_value
FROM sales_data s
JOIN customer_data c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN product_data p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE s.order_date > '2023-01-01'
AND c.loyalty_status = 'Platinum'
ORDER BY s.order_value DESC;
```

### **3. Aggregation Optimization**

Aggregations such as `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()` can be optimized by reducing the dataset size early in the query execution.

For example, instead of calculating the sum of `order_value` across all rows and filtering later, try filtering rows first:

```sql
-- Unoptimized aggregation
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    SUM(s.order_value) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data s
JOIN customer_data c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date > '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
```

Optimized version:

```sql
-- Optimized aggregation
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    SUM(s.order_value) AS total_sales
FROM (SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01') s
JOIN customer_data c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
```

By filtering data early, you reduce the number of rows involved in the aggregation.

## **Testing Performance Before and After Optimization**

After applying the optimization techniques, it's essential to test the performance. Here’s how you can measure query performance before and after optimization:

```sql
-- Test query execution time before optimization
SELECT NOW();
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    SUM(s.order_value) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data s
JOIN customer_data c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
SELECT NOW();
```

Take note of the execution time by comparing `NOW()` times.

After optimizing, repeat the same query and compare the difference in execution times.

## **Reporting & Dashboards**

Once the queries are optimized, you can integrate them into reporting tools like **Tableau**, **Power BI**, or any other dashboarding tool for live reporting.
