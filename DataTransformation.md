## **Project: Sales Performance Data Transformation & Reporting**

### **Overview**
This project focuses on transforming raw sales data into actionable business insights. It involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, removing duplicates, aggregating key metrics, and generating performance reports. The ultimate goal is to help the business identify trends, areas of improvement, and overall sales performance.

### **Data Source**
The project uses a hypothetical `sales_data` table which records sales transactions. This table might look like this:

| order_id | product_id | customer_id | order_value | order_date   | region   |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| 1001     | P001       | C001        | 250.00      | 2023-05-01   | East     |
| 1002     | P002       | C002        | 175.00      | 2023-05-03   | West     |
| 1003     | P001       | C001        | 300.00      | 2023-05-04   | East     |
| 1004     | P003       | C003        | 400.00      | 2023-05-06   | North    |
| 1005     | P002       | C004        | 150.00      | 2023-05-07   | South    |

### **Key Tasks**
1. **Data Cleansing**  
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Handle missing values (e.g., missing order values or dates).
   - Ensure correct data types (e.g., `order_value` should be numeric).

2. **Data Transformation**  
   - Aggregate sales by product and region.
   - Calculate key metrics like total sales, average order value, and number of orders.
   - Segment customers based on their total spend.

3. **Reporting**  
   - Create a report summarizing sales performance by region.
   - Calculate top-performing products based on total sales.
   - Generate customer segmentation report based on spend.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

---

### 1. **Data Cleansing**

#### Remove Duplicates

To ensure that our analysis isn't impacted by duplicate records, I’ll identify and remove any duplicates based on the `order_id` column.

```sql
-- Remove duplicate rows based on order_id
WITH Deduplicated AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT * FROM sales_data
)
SELECT * FROM Deduplicated;
```

#### Handle Missing Values

I’ll check for missing values in critical columns like `order_value` and `order_date`. If a value is missing, I'll fill it with appropriate defaults or remove those rows.

```sql
-- Fill missing order_value with the average order_value
WITH Cleaned AS (
  SELECT 
    order_id,
    product_id,
    customer_id,
    COALESCE(order_value, (SELECT AVG(order_value) FROM sales_data)) AS order_value,
    order_date,
    region
  FROM sales_data
)
SELECT * FROM Cleaned;
```

#### Ensure Correct Data Types

I can also check for any non-numeric values in the `order_value` column.

```sql
-- Check for non-numeric values in order_value column
SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE NOT order_value ~ '^\d+(\.\d+)?$';
```

---

### 2. **Data Transformation & Aggregation**

#### Total Sales by Region

I’ll calculate total sales by region to understand where most of the revenue is coming from.

```sql
-- Aggregate total sales by region
SELECT region, SUM(order_value) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;
```

#### Average Order Value (AOV) by Region

This gives us insights into the average sales amount per order in each region.

```sql
-- Calculate the average order value (AOV) by region
SELECT region, AVG(order_value) AS average_order_value
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;
```

#### Customer Segmentation Based on Spend

I’ll segment customers into different categories based on their total spend.

```sql
-- Segment customers based on total spend
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(order_value) AS total_spent,
    CASE 
        WHEN SUM(order_value) > 1000 THEN 'High Value'
        WHEN SUM(order_value) BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN 'Medium Value'
        ELSE 'Low Value'
    END AS customer_segment
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

---

### 3. **Reporting**

#### Sales Performance by Product

This report helps identify which products are contributing the most to sales.

```sql
-- Calculate total sales by product
SELECT product_id, SUM(order_value) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

#### Sales Performance by Date Range (Monthly Report)

I can create a report to see how sales have performed over time (monthly aggregation).

```sql
-- Aggregate sales by month
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    SUM(order_value) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

---

### **Visualizations & Dashboards**

Once the data is aggregated, I can use visualization tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, or **Matplotlib** (Python) to create dashboards.

1. **Sales Performance by Region** – Bar chart showing total sales by region.
2. **Top Products** – Bar chart showing the top-selling products.
3. **Customer Segmentation** – Pie chart showing the distribution of customer segments.

---

### **Further Improvements**
- Implement **ETL workflows** for automation using tools like Airflow or dbt.
- Include **time-series analysis** to forecast future sales trends using SQL or Python.
- Integrate this workflow with a cloud platform like **AWS** or **Azure** for scalable reporting.
